Abstract
Identify, classifying states that may indicate abnormal behavior
Signal preprocessing: Peak detection, garbage removal and down-sampling
Ward's hierarchical clustering with multivariate Euclidean distance calculation and Kohonen self-organizing map to grouping similar pattern 
Visual display can be monitored
Clustered signal can create a balance set for learning
